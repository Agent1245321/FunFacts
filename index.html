<h2>Fun Fact of the Day!</h2>
<p> Weird Al Yankovic wrote a parody song for "Live and Let Die" called "Chicken Pot Pie" about the eponymous food. The parody was originally greenlit by Paul McCartney until he learned the subject matter of the song. He refused the song because he was a vehement vegetarian and didn't want his song associated with the consumption of meat</p>
