<h2>Fun Fact of the Day!</h2>
<p> "Gravity accelerates things at a rate of 9.8 meters per second squared. That means that if something is unsupported it will begin accelerating towards the earth at an ever increasing rate. Eventually an object reaches a speed where the drag has become so large it can no longer speed up via gravity, this is know as the terminal velocity of an object. The terminal velocity for a coin is 67 miles per hour, a speed which is not infact fast enough to cause lethal harm to a person."</p>
