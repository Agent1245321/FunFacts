<h2 class="headings">Fun Fact of the Day!!!</h2>
<p>Fun Fact: "On a livestreamed Mario 64 speedrun something happened that caused a single bit to be flipped, sending Mario's position up slightly. If properly anticipated this could've been used to cut the time of the run down significantly, however the speedrunner didn't expect it and it caused an early end to the run. The cause of the bit flipping is unknown but the current leading theory is that a charged particle from a solar flare hit the bit perfectly causing it to flip"</p>
