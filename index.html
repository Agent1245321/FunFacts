<p>The oldest game we've ever found evidence of is called the royal game of Ur. It uses four sided dice to race your tokens around the board. When we were first recreating the rules of this game the only set of rules for it we had translated were somebody's home rules for how to add gambling to the game, he just happened to also include the regular rules as examples of what his changes would do</p>
