<h2>Fun Fact of the Day!</h2>
<p> You can record any digital media to an analogue device, such as a VHS or Tape recorder, by simply plugging the device in, telling your computer that it's headphones and hitting record while playing whatever it is you're trying to record. You can then convert it back to a digital file by simply opening an app like Audacity, unplugging the device, plugging it back in as a microphone, and playing the tape back. This allows you to get permanent files for things like TV shows on streaming websites</p>
