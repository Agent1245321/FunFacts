<h2>Fun Fact of the Day!</h2>
<p> The New Mexico towns of Los Alamos and Oakridge were built to blend in with the shape and contour of the land so they would be nearly impossible to see from the sky. They did this because those towns were a major part of creating nuclear weaponry during the Manhattan Project and they didn't want them to be seen by enemies flying overhead</p>
