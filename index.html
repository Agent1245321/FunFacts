<h2>Fun Fact of the Day!!!</h2>
<p>Fun Fact: The first video game to have progressively increasing difficulty did it by complete accident. The game Space Invaders has aliens slowly move down the screen towards the player, with the aliens getting faster as more of them are killed. The aliens getting faster is actually not an intentional behavior, the aliens simply get faster as you kill them because as the game has to track fewer aliens it's able to process things faster allowing for faster movement. This unintentional bit of game design made Space Invaders a massive hit</p>
