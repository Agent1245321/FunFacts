<h2 class="headings">Fun Fact of the Day!!!</h2>
<p>Fun Fact: "The constellation known as "the Pleiades" is supposed to represent seven sisters, despite this there are only actually six stars in the constellation, the story of the constellation often says that this is because one of the sisters got lost and the others are looking for her. Modern science however has found that there were originally seven stars and one slowly moved behind one of the others, making it no longer visible. The myth of the Pleiades is so old that it describes the stars moving in the sky over centuries of time"</p>
